      When you share images and messages on social networking sites, post a personal blog or leave a comment on a website, you're creating a “digital identity” for yourself – an online presence that others might view as an extension of the real you.
      If you're an experienced social media user you'll be familiar with this information already – but if you're a new or intermittent user of social media, or hesitant to use it because of privacy concerns, it's important to understand what social media is, why you might want to use it, and the type of footprint your online activity will make.

      Tips for Takin Care

       1. Never share passwords with anyone other than your parents. Passwords are personal and should be protected as much as you protect the keys to your house. <br>
        
        2. Never share personal information such as your name, address, email address, phone number, or what school you attend with people you do not know personally. <br>
        
        3. Remember your favourite websites by using the history button and the bookmark function on your computer or mobile device. This is a way that your digital footprint can work in your favour, but remember to clear your browser history regularly. <br>
        
       4.  Don’t forget to log off when you leave a website, especially if you are using a shared computer. If you don’t, someone can easily pretend to be you!

      If you don't want your friends, family, school, or employer to know something, don't post it. Even if you think it's fun to share lots of information about yourself, think about how that information could put you or your future in jeopardy. Be careful about sharing too much personal information about yourself (e.g., physical address, complete birthdate, etc.) in your profile or posts. Although most social media offer some privacy controls, those settings do not grant you total control of your information. Ask your friends to be considerate of your reputation—being tagged in a compromising photo can be just as damaging to your reputation as if you had posted that photo yourself. You should assume that any information you post—or any posted about you—will be public.

        Remember it’s not just employers who see your posts – family and friends are also impacted by what you put online. Make sure you're happy for whatever you share to be visible online. Once it’s out there, it’s difficult to take it back.
